============================================================
 FUNCTIONAL = working class with little to no errors
 PROTOTYPE = may work, may not; still in-testing
 OUTLINED = primarily pseudo-code; most likely won't compile
============================================================

** coursesDB.txt
- test file for courses

** studentDB.txt
- test file for student accounts

** GetCourseList (PROTOTYPE)
- HTML parsing class
- hasn't been tested
- skeleton code written

** Account (FUNCTIONAL)
- removed classes extending Account
- - "Tutor" is just a boolean field in Account instead of an entirely new class
- Three different constructors to handle new Account cases

** AccountDatabase (FUNCTIONAL)
- This is the ArrayList library that manages the database of Accounts
- - loads data and saves data to text files correctly

** Course (FUNCTIONAL)
- base functions written

** CourseDatabase (FUNCTIONAL)
- base functions written
- can read/write from/to txt file

** Main (FUNCTIONAL)
- student and course databases initialized
- file paths/name are set as class fields
- - easier to modify as needed per everyone's differentt computer devices
- - - .getAbsolutePath() is used, so hopefully this won't be necessary
